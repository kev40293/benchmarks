CPU Benchmark Program

Usage: ./cpubench

Performs cpu benchmark to determine GFLOPS/GIOPS

EX: ./cpubench

Memory Benchmark Program

Usage: ./membench

Performs memory benchmark to determine read+write speeds, access speeds.

Usage: ./membench -b x[B,K,M] -m [1,2,3] -t x

-b      Block size, bytes/kilobytes/megabytes
-t      Thread number
-m      Mode, 1: Sequential access benchmark, 2: Random access benchmark, 3: Memcpy benchmark

EX: ./membench -t 1 -b 1M -m 3
    Performs memcpy benchmark using 1M block size and 1 thread.

Usage: ./diskbench -[rt] -b[K,M,G]

Performs disk I/O benchmark to determine read/write speeds

-r      Run read benchmark instead of write
-t      Run in threaded mode
-b[KMG] Use a blocksize of K(ilobyte) M(egabyte) G(igabyte)

EX: ./diskbench -t -bK
        perform disk benchmark with multiple threads and a block size of 1 KB


Network Benchmark Program

Usage: ./netbench [-pu] [-tN] [-bN[KMG]] [-dN[KMG]] [-s] [-c <ipaddress>]

-p      run parallel clients
-u      Run in udp mode
-tN     Run for N seconds
-bN[KMG] use buffer size of N[KMG] bytes
-dN     send N bytes instead of for specific duration
-s      Run in server mode
-c <ipaddress>
        Run in client mode to server on ipaddress

EX: 
./netbench -s -b64K
        Run in server mode with a buffer size of 64 KB

./netbench -t10 -b64K -c 127.0.0.1
        Connect to server at 127.0.0.1 and transmit 64KB blocks for 10 seconds
                using tcp

Usage: ./cpubench

Performs cpu benchmark using 1,2 and 4 threads


Usage: ./membench -b x[B,K,M] -t x -m x

Performs memory benchmark 

-b x[B,K,M]      Block size, byte/kilobyte/megabyte
-t x             Thread number
-m [1-3]         1, Sequential access test, 2, Random access test, 3, Memcpy test

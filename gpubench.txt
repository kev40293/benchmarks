Compile: nvcc -o gpubench gpubench.cu
Usage: ./gpubench [mg]

./gpubench g runs the gpu flop/iop portion
./gpubench m runs the gpu memory testing.

Design:
   The flop iop portion is done by taking two reasonably large arrays of either integers
   or floats. It then adds all the elements of the arrays using the gpu
   at least a million times. This way the gpu gets saturated with work and we can
   better measure peak FLOP and IOP performance.

   For the memory, we take two malloced regions in the GPU's memory and malloc between
   the 2^30 times, using the various given block sizes. By using the same malloced regions
   we cut out the time for mallocing and freeing and concentrate on the time to move
   the data in the GPU's memory.

Usage: ./diskbench -[rt] -b[K,M,G]

Performs disk I/O benchmark to determine read/write speeds

-r      Run read benchmark instead of write
-t      Run in threaded mode
-b[KMG] Use a blocksize of K(ilobyte) M(egabyte) G(igabyte)


Design:
        Use the main function to parse arguments and determine action to take
        either read or write. Then call the desired function.

        The write function generates a large array of 1 GB and writes to an
        empty file in binary mode. This reduces any need for data
        initialization. One tradeoff i made was writing from preinitialized
        memory without looping. This limits the size of the test but provides a more
        pure measurement.

        The read function reads from /dev/zero to facilitate not having to
        pregenerate a file for the test. Again the same tradeoff is made where the
        test is not looped creating more purity for the test but limiting the data
        size.

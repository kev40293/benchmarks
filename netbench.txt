Usage: ./netbench [-pu] [-tN] [-bN[KMG]] [-dN[KMG]] [-s] [-c <ipaddress>]

-p      run parallel clients
-u      Run in udp mode
-tN     Run for N seconds
-bN[KMG] use buffer size of N[KMG] bytes
-dN     send N bytes instead of for specific duration
-s      Run in server mode
-c <ipaddress>
        Run in client mode to server on ipaddress

The netbench program performs benchmarking of the network connection between
two nodes or over the local loopback interface. If no data parameter is
specified then the program will send as much data as it can over the network
in ten seconds. If a -t parameter is specified it will use that time instead.
if -d is specified, the program will send the specified amount of data over
the network instead of for a specific time. The default protocol used is TCP
but is set to use UDP by specifying the -u parameter. By using -b the user can
specify the buffer size to use for network sends.

By default if neither -c or -s are specified, the program will run both the
client and server internally and benchmark the local loopback interface. If
the user specifies -s, the program will run in server mode and wait for the
client to connect. The client is run with -c and specifies the ip address the
server is listening on. If both -s and -c are set then it will run as if
neither are.

The output of the benchmark is in the appropriate measurement of bits per
second.
